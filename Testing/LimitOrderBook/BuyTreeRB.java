    Rules of Red Black Tree
     1. Every node is either red or black
     2. Root is always  black
     3. No 2 cosecutive red nodes allowed, red child cannot have red parent and vice versa
     4. Number of black nodes from every node to all its descendent leaves should be same
     Notes:
    - A Red-Black Tree is less strict than an AVL tree in balancing height.
    - The height of the longest path can be at most twice that of the shortest path.
    - Because of this relaxed balancing, insertions and deletions are generally
      faster than in AVL trees.
